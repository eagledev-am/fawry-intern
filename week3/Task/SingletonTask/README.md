# Singleton Task
## Problem 
### The problem that arises when two threads attempt to access the singleton instance simultaneously is known as a "race condition." This situation can lead to the creation of multiple instances of the singleton class, which violates the fundamental principle of the singleton pattern, which is to ensure that only one instance of the class exists in the system.

Here's how the problem typically occurs:
- **Simultaneous Invocation**: When two threads attempt to access the getInstance() method of a singleton class concurrently, they might both determine that the singleton instance has not been created yet.

- **Double Initialization**: If both threads are allowed to proceed simultaneously, they may both create an instance of the singleton class, resulting in two distinct objects being created.

## solution
### To prevent this issue, various techniques can be employed to make the singleton instantiation thread-safe. 
- **Synchronize** the getInstance() Method: One straightforward solution is to synchronize the getInstance() method to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time. While this approach is simple, it can introduce performance overhead due to synchronization.
- **Lazy Initialization** with Double-Checked Locking (DCL): This technique involves checking if the instance is null before acquiring the lock, and if it is, then acquiring the lock to create the instance. This approach reduces the overhead of synchronization by only locking when necessary.
